# PageWeave Work Journal

**Current status:** Master instruction pack and PRD documents created. This documentation task did not inspect or build the PageWeave application. No training run, cloud upload, scheduler, packaged build or production verification is claimed.

## Initial checkpoint
- Date: 2026-10-16
- Repository commit/branch: not provided in this documentation-generation task
- Next action: inspect the actual project, reconcile existing code/docs against PRDs, establish baseline build/tests/licenses/format support, make requirement traceability matrix, and implement/test the monitor and first vertical slice.
- Build/test status: application tests not run here.
- Model checkpoint: none verified here.
- Watchdog: specified, not installed or test-verified by this document-generation task.

## 2026-10-16 — Session 1, checkpoint 1: PRD pack installed, foundation decisions
- Branch: `ccr-81913227-01wzmc`. Environment: Linux x64 cloud container (no Windows machine available here).
- Installed PRD suite (`prd/`), updated `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/FEATURE_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, `docs/HARDWARE_SUPPORT.md`, `.claude/rules/data-rights-and-experiments.md`.
- Decisions D-001…D-005 recorded as provisional in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (Tauri 2 + TS UI; PDFium chromium/7881 via pdfium-render 0.9.4; workspace layout; synthetic fixtures; runtime-only credentials). DW-001 still open.
- Added `.gitignore` (PRD 16 exclusions), `resources/pdfium.lock.json`, `tools/fetch_pdfium.py`, `tools/fixtures/gen_fixtures.py`, `fixtures/pdf/*`.
- Commands/results: `python3 -I tools/fetch_pdfium.py` → installed (exit 0); rerun → already_installed (exit 0); tampered archive → checksum mismatch (exit 4), nothing installed; network download → installed (exit 0). Fixtures: 6 valid PDFs parsed with `pypdf` strict mode (page counts/sizes/text as expected).
- Next: `crates/pw-core` foundation with unit tests.

## 2026-10-16 — Session 1, checkpoint 2–3: core, engine adapter, CLI
- Requirement IDs: CORE-RANGE-001, CORE-OUT-001, CORE-JOB-001, PDF-OPEN/INSPECT/SEARCH/TEXT/VIEW-001, PDF-ORG-*-001, CLI-001 (see `docs/FEATURE_PARITY_MATRIX.md`).
- Added `crates/pw-core`, `crates/pw-pdf`, `crates/pw-cli`, encrypted fixture (`tools/fixtures/gen_encrypted.py`), `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `third_party/licenses/pdfium/`.
- Commands/results (Linux x64 container, rustc 1.97.0): `cargo test --workspace` → 71 passed (core 43, engine 19, CLI 9), 0 failed; engine/job tests repeated 5–15× with no flakes; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings` clean; `cargo build --release -p pw-cli` ok.
- Defects found by tests and fixed: (1) unencrypted PDFs reported as encrypted (security-handler mapping); (2) first bookmark dropped (`iter_siblings` skips self); (3) outputs from encrypted inputs failed verification — now reopened with the source password; extract/delete/merge/split outputs lose protection (measured) and now carry an explicit warning.
- Security fix from review: release builds no longer probe a compiled-in build path or env var for `pdfium.dll` (DLL hijack); verified release binary contains no `third_party` path and returns `missing_resource` (exit 10) without the DLL.
- NOT RUN: read-only destination test (container runs as root); anything on Windows; desktop UI; performance baselines.
- Next: Tauri desktop app slice (open/view/thumbnails/zoom/search/page tools/settings), then CI with a Windows job.
